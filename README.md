# [SkillFinder](http://skillfinder1.azurewebsites.net/)

A personal project inspired by [Emilianopp](https://github.com/Emilianopp/SkillQuery). 

Tech company's job postings usually list out an overwhleming amount of technical skills and soft skills.  
I hope this website could help fresh graduates or someone who looking for a data science related job to decide  
what skills to learn and focus on.

Frontend is based on python Flask, HTML, JavaScript.  
Backend respository could be accessed from [here](https://github.com/czlee0223/skill_finder).
